Closing the Alignment Gap: The Resonant State Alignment
Algorithm (RSAA) for Deliberative Intelligence
Gianne P . Bacay [ARCANE Research. Email: giannebacay2004@gmail.com]
Abstract
Traditional feed-forward architectures suf fer from a fundamental limitation: information flows in one direction,
preventing lower layers from revising their representations based on higher-level context. This creates an
Alignment Gap  between local feature extraction and global semantic coherence. Backpropagation addresses this
only retrospectively , adjusting weights after errors propagate to the output, but it cannot refine internal states in
real-time before a response is committed. To solve this problem, I developed the Resonant State Alignment
Algorithm (RSAA) , which closes this gap by enabling hierarchical systems to achieve internal coherence
prospectively  through iterative bi-directional state refinement. RSAA  decouples state alignment from weight
modification: layers first "resonate" to reach mutual consistency , then optionally update weights based on the
aligned states. This is the first formalization of a deliberative alignment mechanism that allows computational
systems to "think" before responding. The algorithm is substrate-agnostic, applying beyond neural networks to
quantum variational circuits, cybernetic control systems, and multi-agent coordination.
1. Introduction
In a hierarchical computational system H with L layers, each layer i∈{1,…,L} maintains an internal state
representation Si∈Rdi. Traditional neural architectures process information in a single feed-forward pass,
mapping inputs to outputs without any opportunity for layers to "re-evaluate" their conclusions based on higher-
level context. This unidirectional flow creates a significant Alignment Gap : a disconnect between low-level feature
extraction and high-level contextual constraints.
The textbook approach to neural learning, backpropagation, combined with advanced optimizers such as Adam or
SGD with momentum, solves the credit assignment problem by propagating a global error signal backward
through the network. However , this approach is:
For biological neural systems, the neocortex is organized into a hierarchy where every feed-forward connection is
matched by a feedback connection. Predictive Coding theory suggests that the brain constantly generates top-
down predictions about what lower-level inputs should  be, and learning occurs when these predictions fail to
match reality .
1.1 Main Results
In this paper , I present the Resonant State Alignment Algorithm (RSAA), a formal algorithm for closing the
Alignment Gap through iterative state refinement, enabling deliberative intelligence in hierarchical systems.
Theorem 1.1.  There exists a deterministic algorithm that takes O(N⋅L) time to achieve Prospective Configuration
in a hierarchy H of L layers, where N is the number of resonance cycles. The algorithm operates solely on
internal state activations {S1,…,SL} without modifying synaptic weights W.
Note that the algorithm is substrate-agnostic; it applies equally to artificial neural networks, quantum variational
circuits, cybernetic control systems, and multi-agent coordination mechanisms.1. Retrospective : It identifies errors after an output is generated.
2. Global : It requires a complete forward pass before any correction can occur .
3. Biologically Implausible : The brain does not utilize such global error signals.

1.2 Technical Overview
Broadly speaking, there are two traditional paradigms for neural computation:
My approach merges these two paradigms through a Resonance Loop  technique. At any point during the
execution of RSAA, each layer maintains a "state" Si that represents its current interpretation of the input. A higher
layer i can "project" its expectation Pi→i−1 to the layer below , and the lower layer i−1 can "harmonize" its state to
reduce the divergence Δi−1=Si−1−Pi→i−1.
The key insight is that by iterating this projection-harmonization cycle N times before  any weight update or output
commitment, the hierarchy reaches an equilibrium state where all layers are mutually consistent. I call this
equilibrium Resonance .
My most essential idea is the separation of state alignment  from weight modification . Traditional learning
conflates these two processes: the only way to reduce error is to change weights. RSAA  decouples them: states
are first aligned (Prospective Configuration), and only then are weights optionally updated based on the aligned
states. This yields several benefits:
2. Preliminaries
Definition 2.1 (Resonant Hierarchy).  A Resonant Hierarchy H is an ordered set of L layers, where each layer i
maintains:
Definition 2.2 (Feedback Projection).  For a layer i, the Feedback Projection to layer i−1 is:
Pi→i−1=f(i)
proj(Si;Wi,proj)
In the ARCANE implementation, this is typically the matrix transpose of the input weights:
Pi→i−1=Si⋅WT
i
Definition 2.3 (Prediction Divergence).  The Prediction Divergence at layer i−1 is the signed dif ference
between its current state and the expectation projected from above:
Δi−1=Si−1−Pi→i−1
Definition 2.4 (Global Divergence).  The Global Divergence D of a hierarchy H is the sum of squared local
divergences:
D=L−1
∑
i=1∥Δi∥2
Definition 2.5 (Resonance).  A hierarchy H is said to be in Resonance when D<ϵ for some threshold ϵ>0.Feed-Forward Inference : Information flows from input to output in a single pass. This is computationally
efficient but lacks deliberative capacity .
Backpropagation Learning : A global error signal propagates backward to adjust weights. This is ef fective for
learning but does not refine activations in real-time.
Stability : Local corrections prevent gradient explosion/vanishing.
Deliberation : The system can "think" before committing to an output.
Biological Plausibility : The mechanism mirrors neocortical feedback loops.

3. The RSAA Algorithm
3.1 State Harmonization
The core operation of RSAA  is the State Harmonization update rule.
Lemma 3.1 (Harmonization Update).  Given a layer i−1 with state S(t)
i−1 and an incoming projection Pi→i−1, the
harmonized state at cycle t+1 is:
S(t+1)
i−1=S(t)
i−1−γ⋅Δ(t)
i−1
where γ∈(0,1] is the Resonance Factor .
Proof.  The update directly minimizes the local divergence ∥Δi−1∥2 via gradient descent on the state variable Si−1.
Since Δi−1=Si−1−Pi→i−1, the gradient with respect to Si−1 is ∇Si−1∥Δi−1∥2=2Δi−1. A gradient descent step
with learning rate γ/2 yields the update rule. □
3.2 Convergence
Theorem 3.2 (Convergence of RSAA).  For a Resonant Hierarchy H with fixed projections {Pi→i−1}, the RSAA
update rule converges to D=0 as N→∞, provided γ∈(0,1].
Proof.  At each cycle, the local divergence ∥Δ(t+1)
i−1∥2=∥(1−γ)Δ(t)
i−1∥2=(1−γ)2∥Δ(t)
i−1∥2. Since (1−γ)2<1 for
γ∈(0,1], the divergence decreases geometrically . Summing over all layers, D(t+1)≤(1−γ)2D(t), which
converges to 0. □

4. Substrate Agnosticism
A key property of RSAA  is that it operates on abstract principles (state-space negotiation, local correction
dynamics, stability-driven refinement) rather than assumptions unique to artificial neural networks.
Corollary 4.1.  RSAA  can be instantiated in any system S that satisfies:
This includes:
5. Conclusion
The Resonant State Alignment Algorithm (RSAA) closes the Alignment Gap by providing a rigorous mathematical
basis for deliberative intelligence. By treating alignment as a dynamic convergence process rather than a static
mapping, RSAA  allows computational systems to achieve internal coherence before committing to an output. The
decoupling of state alignment from weight modification represents a paradigm shift from purely retrospective
learning toward prospective, self-modeling computation. This work demonstrates that deliberative intelligence, the
capacity to "think" before responding, can be formally achieved through iterative resonant state refinement.

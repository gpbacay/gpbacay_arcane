We introduce VL-JEPA, a vision-language model built on a Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA).
Instead of autoregressively generating tokens as in classical VLMs, VL-JEPA predictscontinuous embeddingsof
the target texts. By learning in an abstract representation space, the model focuses on task-relevant semantics
while abstracting away surface-level linguistic variability. In a strictly controlled comparison against standard
token-spaceVLMtrainingwiththesamevisionencoderandtrainingdata,VL-JEPAachievesstrongerperformance
while having 50% fewer trainable parameters. At inference time, a lightweight text decoder is invoked only when
neededtotranslateVL-JEPApredictedembeddingsintotext. WeshowthatVL-JEPAnativelysupportsselective
decodingthat reduces the number of decoding operations by ∼2.85×while maintaining similar performance
compared to non-adaptive uniform decoding. Beyond generation, the VL-JEPA’s embedding space naturally
supportsopen-vocabularyclassification,text-to-videoretrieval,anddiscriminativeVQAwithoutanyarchitecture
modification. Oneightvideoclassificationandeightvideoretrievaldatasets,theaverageperformanceVL-JEPA
surpasses that of CLIP, SigLIP2, and Perception Encoder. At the same time, the model achieves comparable
performanceasclassicalVLMs(InstructBLIP,QwenVL)onfourVQAdatasets: GQA,TallyQA,POPEandPOPEv2,
despite only having 1.6B parameters.
1 Introduction
Oneofthemostimportantaspectsofadvancedmachine
intelligence is the ability to understand the physical world
thatsurroundsus. ThisabilityenablesAIsystemstolearn,
reason, plan and act in the real world in order to assist
humans [LeCun, 2022]. Intelligent systems that need to
act in the real world includes wearable devices and robots
[Fungetal.,2025]. Machinelearningtasksthatmakeupfor
this ability include captioning, retrieval, visual question
answering, action tracking, reasoning and planning etc
[Bordesetal.,2024,Chenetal.,2025b]. Systemsforsuch
real-worldapplicationsmusthavereal-timeresponsewith
low latency and inference cost.
Currently, the common approach to achieve these tasks
istouselargetoken-generativeVisionLanguageModels
(VLMs) [Liu et al., 2023, Dai et al., 2023, Alayrac et al.,
2022, Chen et al., 2024b, Cho et al., 2025, Chen et al., 2022],
which takes visual input 𝑋𝑉, textual query 𝑋𝑄to generate
desiredtextualresponse 𝑌autoregressivelyintokenspace,
i.e.,(𝑋𝑉,𝑋𝑄)↦→𝑌. Thisisstraightforwardbutinadequate
for two main reasons. First, VLMs are expensive to de-
velop, because they are trained to generate responses 𝑌
to queries by capturing both task-relevant semantics with
task-irrelevant surface linguistic features such as words
choice, style or paraphrasing. During training, VLMs
must model both aspects, which results in unnecessary

Second,real-timetasksinvolvinglivestreamingvideo(e.g.,

[Zhouetal.,2024]. However,VLMsrelyonautoregressive

Fig. 1, the model employsx-encoderto map vision inputs
𝑋𝑉into embedding 𝑆𝑉, ay-encoderto map the textual
target𝑌intoanembedding 𝑆𝑌,andapredictorthatlearns
themapping(𝑆𝑉,𝑋𝑄)↦→𝑆𝑌where𝑋𝑄isatextualquery
(i.e.,the prompt). The training objective is defined in
theembeddingspace ℒVL-JEPA =𝐷(ˆ𝑆𝑌,𝑆𝑌)insteadofthe
data spaceℒVLM=𝐷(ˆ𝑌,𝑌). During inference, ay-decoder
reads out the predicted embedding ˆ𝑆𝑌to text spaceˆ𝑌
when needed.
Thanks to itsnon-generativenature, VL-JEPA is not
forced to reconstruct every surface detail of 𝑌in the token
space. Instead,itonlyneedstopredicttheabstractrepre-
sentation𝑆𝑌intheembeddingspace. Intherawone-hot
token space, different plausible 𝑌outputs for the same
input often appear nearly orthogonal if they don’t share
overlapping tokens. However, in the embedding space,
these diverse targets can be mapped to nearby points that
share similar semantics. This simplifies the target distri-
bution thusmakes thelearning process moreefficient. In
addition, unlike VLMs, this approach eliminates the need
for learning language generation with a heavy decoder
during training, resulting in significant efficiency gains.
Thanks to itsnon-autoregressivenature, VL-JEPA can
produce continuous streams of target semantic embed-
dingswithinslidingwindowswithminimallatencyasit
only require a single forward pass without autoregressive
decoding. Thisisparticularlyadvantageousforreal-time
online applications such as live action tracking, scene
recognition, or planning, where the embedding stream
can be selectively decoded by a lightweight y-decoder,
enabling efficient and prompt updates.
In this work, we empirically validate the advantages
ofVL-JEPA.Weconductastrictlycontrolledcomparison
against classical token-generative VLM [Liu et al., 2023,
Cho et al., 2025]: both setups use the same vision encoder,
spatial resolution, frame rate, training data, batch size,
and number of iterations, etc., with theonlydifference
being the objective in token space or embedding space.
Under this matched training condition, VL-JEPA delivers
consistently higher performance on zero-shot captioning
and classification while using roughly half the trainable
parameters, indicating that embedding-space supervision
improves learning efficiency.
Beyondthetrainingphase,VL-JEPAalsodeliverssub-
stantial inference-time efficiency improvement through
selective decoding, where decoding happens only due to
significant change in the predicted embedding stream.
Empirically, this strategy reduces the number of decod-
ing operations by∼2.85×while preserving overall output
quality measured by average CIDEr scores.
Our final VL-JEPA models are trained in two stages: 1)

(SFT) stage that equips the model with VQA capabili-
ties. Themodelresultingfromthefirststage,denotedas

quence of continuous vectors analogous to “visual
tokens” in classical VLMs.
2.Predictor(⟨𝑆 𝑉,𝑋𝑄⟩↦→ˆ𝑆𝑌)is the core component
of VL-JEPA. It maps visual embeddings to a predic-
tion of target embedding, with a textual query as
conditioning.
3.Y-Encoder(𝑌↦→𝑆 𝑌)embedsthetextualtargetinto
a continuous latent space as the prediction target.
The targetembedding is expected to abstractaway
task irrelevant information.
4.Y-Decoder(ˆ𝑆𝑌↦→ˆ𝑌)is not involved during the
maintrainingphraseofVL-JEPA.Atinferencetime,
it translates the predicted embedding as human-
readable text when necessary.
Fig. 2 illustrates how we instantiate the VL-JEPA ar-
chitecture in this paper. For the X-Encoder , we chose
V-JEPA 2 [Assran et al., 2025], a Vision Transformer that
outputsasequenceofvisualtokens,whicharethenpro-
jected and fed into the Predictor initialized using Llama
3Transformerlayers. Queryconditioningisachievedby
tokenizing and embedding the textual query and feeding
theresultingtextualtokenembeddingsintothe Predictor
along with the visual embeddings. The outputs of the
Llama 3 Transformer layers are pooled and projected into
thetargetembeddingspaceproducedbythe Y-Encoder ,
which is initialized by EmbeddingGemma-300M [Vera
et al., 2025]. We provide more technical details in §??.
Training Objective.JEPA models typically optimize
two objectives jointly: 1) prediction error in the embed-
ding space, and 2) additional regularization that avoids
representation collapse [Bardes et al., 2021, Balestriero
and LeCun, 2025]. Any loss that implements these two
properties can be applied to VL-JEPA. Alternatively, theregularization term can be replaced by other anti-collapse
strategies,suchasusinganexponentialmovingaverage
(EMA)forthe Y-Encoder [Assranetal.,2025]orfreezing
theY-Encoder[Zhou et al., 2025].
In this work, we adopt theInfoNCE loss[Radford
et al., 2021] due to its maturity in the vision-language
domain. Moreadvancednon-sample-contrastiveregular-
ization,suchasVICReg[Bardesetal.,2021]andSIGReg
[Balestriero and LeCun, 2025] can also be applied but
we leave the exploration to future works. InfoNCE loss
can be mathematically divided [Wang and Isola, 2020]
into: 1) a representationalignmentterm that minimizes
the distance between normalized prediction and target
embeddings, and 2) auniformityregularization term that
pushes embeddings in a batch apart from each other, thus
avoiding representation collapse. We train the Predictor
and the Y-Encoder jointly with bi-directional InfoNCE
loss, enabling them to mutually learn from each other.
Compared to the token-space loss used by generative
VLMs, calculating the training loss in the embedding
space is beneficial due to thesimplified target distribu-
tion. Specifically, many real-world prediction tasks are
inherently ill-posed: for the same input 𝑋, there may exist
multiple plausible targets 𝑌that are all acceptable. For
example, given the query“What will happen here if I flip
this light switch down?”, both“the lamp is turned off”and
“room will go dark”are valid answers. In the raw one-hot
tokenspace,however,thetwosequencesareorthogonal
since they share no overlapping tokens. But when VL-
JEPA’s Y-Encoder embedsthemintonearbypoints(ideally
yielding a compact unimodal distribution), the learning
taskbecomesmucheasier: themodelnolongerneedsto
fitmultipledisjointhigh-densityregionsinsparsetoken

embedding space.

Selective Decoding.Real-world video applications
often require online streaming inference, such as tracking
user actions in smart glasses for procedural assistance
[Chen et al., 2024c], monitoring world states for online
planning, navigation and robotics [Shukor et al., 2025,
Black et al., 2025, Song et al., 2025]. A central challenge
is balancing two competing needs: the model must con-
tinuously update semantics as new frames arrive, but
computational efficiency and latency are critical.
Existing VLMs typically rely on explicit memory mech-
anisms[Zhouetal.,2024,Qianetal.,2024]todecidewhen
to decode or complex KV-cache optimizations [Di et al.,
2025] for efficiency, since autoregressive language models
are expensive to run continuously. VL-JEPA, in contrast,
natively supports selective decoding. Since it predicts
asemanticanswerembeddingnon-autoregressively,the
modelprovidesacontinuoussemanticstreamof ˆ𝑆𝑌that
canbemonitoredinrealtime. Thisstreamcanbestabilized
withsimplesmoothing(e.g.,averagepooling)anddecoded
only when a significant semantic shift is detected, such as
whenthelocalwindowvarianceexceedsathreshold. In
this way, VL-JEPA maintains always-on semantic monitor-
ing while avoiding unnecessary decoding, achieving both
responsiveness and efficiency.
3 Implementation of VL-JEPA
3.1 Model Architecture
X-Encoder.Unless otherwise specified, we use a frozen
V-JEPA 2 ViT-L [Assran et al., 2025] with 304M param-
eters, a self-supervised vision model that excels at both
image and video tasks. Each video input is uniformly
sampled into frames at 2562resolution. For image inputs,
the same image is duplicated to match the input shape.
Predictor.The predictor is initialized with the last 8
Transformer layers of Llama-3.2-1B , resulting in 490M
trainable parameters. The text tokenizer and token em-
beddingarealsofrom Llama-3.2-1B .Weallowmaximum
512querytokens,andput [PAD]tokensforshortqueries.
Wedisablethecausalattentionmasksothatbothvision
and query embeddings can be jointly attended. Linear
projections connect the predictor with the vision and textembeddings, and average pooling on non- [PAD]tokens is
applied to obtain the predicted target embedding.
Y-Encoder.Weuse EmbeddingGemma-300M [Veraetal.,
2025] as the initialization of the Y-Encoder . We set max-
imum context length of 512 to handle detailed captions.
Wefoundthatsettingalearningratemultiplierof ×0.05to
alltextencoderparametersimprovesperformance,since
thequalityofembeddingpredictionwouldbesuboptimal
in the beginning of training. Linear projection head is
applied to both Predictor and Y-Encoder , obtaining a
shared embedding space with 1,536 dimensions, where
the loss is calculated.
3.2 Two-stage Training
Large-scalePretraining.VL-JEPAistrainedwithtwo
stages. The first query-free pretraining stage aims to es-
tablish robust vision-language alignment using massive
captiondata. WeusePLM-Image-Auto[Choetal.,2025],
Datacomp[Gadreetal.,2023]andYFCC-100M[Thomee
et al., 2016] for image-text data. For video-text data, we
include PLM-Video-Auto [Cho et al., 2025], Ego4D atomic
action descriptions [Grauman et al., 2022], and an inter-
nal dataset Action100M consisting captions generated on
HowTo100M videos [Chen et al., 2025b].
Wefirstdoimage-onlytrainingonDatacompandYFCC-
100M with only 1 frame per visual input, which allows us
tousealargebatchsizeof24k. After100kiterations,the
model has seen 2B samples and achieved 61.6% ImageNet
zero-shot accuracy (without prompt ensembling). Then,
we continue with joint image-video pretraining with 16
frames per input. The pretraining takes 2 weeks using
24 nodes with 8×NVIDIA H200 GPUs each. We adopt
a constant learning rate of 5×10−5to facilitate extended
training. We call the resulting modelVL-JEPA BASEand
measurezero-shotclassification and retreival performance
with this model.
SupervisedFinetuning.Thesecondquery-conditioned
supervised finetuning (SFT) stage empowers VL-JEPA
VQA capabilities while maintaining the pretrained vision-
language alignment for classification and retrieval. The
training data is selected from the PLM data mixture [Cho
etal.,2025],including25MVQAsamples,2.8Mcaptioning
samples,1.8Mclassificationsamples,anddownsampled
pretraining stage data to avoid catastrophic forgetting.
We train the model for 35k steps with a batch size of
6k(∼2dayswith24nodes),withcosinelearningratean-
nealingappliedtoimproveconvergence. Sinceexcessive
human labelled data is included in this SFT data mixture,
we no longer emphasizezero-shotevaluation for the result-
ingVL-JEPA SFTfromthisstage. Instead,weevaluateVQA

4 Experiments
4.1 Classification and Retrieval
We begin by evaluating VL-JEPA’s classification and re-
trievalperformancein§4.1,andbenchmarkVL-JEPAon
VQA datasets in §4.2. We demonstrate application of VL-
JEPA for understanding the relationship between world
statechangesandactionconcepts(i.e.,inversedynamics)in
§4.3. In§4.4,wedemonstratetheadvantageofembedding
predictionbycomparingitwithatoken-predictiveVLM
baseline under a strictly controlled setting. In §4.5, we
evaluate the effectiveness of VL-JEPA’s selective decoding,
and show that it reduces decoding cost while maintaining
theperformance. Next,weanalyzeVL-JEPA’s Y-Encoder
in §4.6.
Evaluation Setup.We evaluate VL-JEPA following the
CLIP-style evaluation protocol (see Fig.2 and §2 “Multi-
tasking”). WeassessVL-JEPAonabroadsuiteofbench-
marks, including 8 classification datasets and 8 retrieval
datasets. Forzero-shotevaluation, we compare against
generalist foundation modelsCLIP [Radford et al., 2021],
SigLIP2[Tschannenetal.,2025], andPerceptionEncoder
(PE-Core)[Bolya et al., 2025]. We additionally report refer-
encenumbersfromspecialistmodelsthatareindividuallyop-
timized for eachbenchmark(summarized inAppendix ??).
Results.Table 1 summarizes the results. In the strict
zero-shot setting, VL-JEPA BASEachieves higher average ac-
curacy(46.4vs44.6)acrossthe8classificationdatasetsand
higher average recall@1 (58.4 vs 58.1) across the 8 retrieval
datasets than the best baseline PE-Core-G. Per-dataset
scores show that VL-JEPA BASEis particularly strong on
motion-centricbenchmarks (SSv2, EK-100, EgoExo4D, and
steprecognitiononCOINandCrossTask),whilerelatively
weakeronappearance-centricbenchmarks(Kinetics-400andtaskrecognitiononCOINandCrossTask). Thisisdueto
VL-JEPA BASEhas seen substantially fewer vision-language
pairs (only 2B in comparison withPE-Core-G’s 86B). After
supervised finetuning, VL-JEPA SFTimproves significantly
upon VL-JEPA BASEsince the model has seen in-domain
trainingdata. Asasinglegeneralistmodel,theperformance
of VL-JEPA SFTis approachingspecialistmodels optimized
individually for each dataset.
4.2 Visual Question Answering
Evaluation Setup.We evaluate VL-JEPA SFTon discrimi-
nativeVQAtasks. Theinferenceprocessinvolvesencode
candidate answers using the Y-Encoder and selecting the
answer that minimizes the distance to the predicted em-
bedding (see Fig. 2). We select four benchmarks that
prioritize visual perception rather than knowledge and
reasoning. WeevaluateonGQA[HudsonandManning,
2019],adatasetforreal-worldvisualreasoningandcom-
positionalQA,reportingaccuracyonthetestdev-balanced
split. For TallyQA [Acharya et al., 2019], which targets
complex counting, we follow Chen et al. [2022] and report
the weighted average accuracy across the “simple” and
“complex” splits. Finally, to assess object hallucination,
we utilize POPE [Li et al., 2023b] and POPEv2 [Li et al.,
2025b]. ForPOPE,wereporttheaverageaccuracyacross

Evaluation Setup.We evaluate VL-JEPA on the “world
modeling”taskintheWorldPrediction[Chenetal.,2025a]
benchmark,wherethemodelisprovidedwithtwoimages
representing the initial and final world states and must
identify, among four candidate video clips, the action
thatexplainstheobservedtransition. ToadaptVL-JEPA,
we duplicate and concatenate the initial and final state
imagestoextractastateembedding,andencodeeachaction
candidateintoactionembeddings. Themodelthenselects
the candidate whose embedding is closest to the state
embedding.
Results.Table 3 shows accuracy comparisons. VL-
JEPA BASEattains63.9%andVL-JEPA SFTattains65.7%top-1
accuracy onWorldPrediction-WM, establishing a new
state of the art. Our VL-JEPA model not only substantially
surpasses existing VLMs of comparable or larger scale but
also exceeds the performance of frontier LLMs such as
GPT-4o, Claude-3.5-sonnet, and Gemini-2.0.
4.4 Embedding Prediction vs. Token
Prediction: A Controlled Comparison
EvaluationSetup.Inthissection,wecompareVL-JEPAto
atoken-generativeVLMbaselineunderastrictlyaligned
training conditions. Both models use the same PerceptionEncoder [Bolya et al., 2025] (frozen ViT-L-14 with 3362
resolution,notiling,16framespervideo)forvisioninputs.
Weusethesametrainingiterationswiththesameeffective
batchsizeof128,samelearningratescheduleronthesame
pretraining data mixture described above (§3). The only
differenceisthepredictiontask: VL-JEPApredictstarget
embeddings[Duquenneetal.,2023]usinga0.5Bpredictor,
whereastheVLMbaselineperformsnext-tokenprediction
with cross-entropy using a 1B LLM. For VLM, we use the
standard training recipe and codebase of PerceptionLM
[Cho et al., 2025], aligning frozen vision encoder and text-
only LLM Llama-3.2-1B . For VL-JEPA, we initialize the
predictor from the 8-16 layers ofLlama-3.2-1B.
Weevaluatebothmodelsatregularcheckpointsthrough-
out training spanning from 500K to 15M samples seen. At
each checkpoint, we measure the performance on video
captioning and video classification. For video captioning,
we report CIDEr scores averaged across YouCook2 [Zhou
et al., 2018], MSR-VTT [Xu et al., 2016] and PVD-Bench
[Bolyaetal.,2025]. VL-JEPAdecodesthepredictedembed-
dings while VLM generates the tokens directly. For video
classification, we report top-5 accuracy averaged across
CrossTask-Step,CrossTask-Task[Zhukovetal.,2019]and
EgoExo4D [Grauman et al., 2024]. For VL-JEPA we choose
the candidate with lowest cosine distance to the predicted
embedding,whileforVLMwepicktheclasswithlowest
perplexity.
Results.As shown in Fig. 3, both models yield compa-
rableperformanceafter500Ksamplesseeninbothtasks,
with respectively 1.23 and 1.35 CIDEr in video captioning
and 14.9% and 14.0% top-5 accuracy for VL-JEPA and

Results on EgoExo4D show that selective decoding achieves a Pareto improvement over uniform sampling: for the same performance level, it requires

parisonhighlightsthebenefitofpredictingembeddings
rather than tokens, showing both higher sample efficiency
and stronger absolute performance.
WecomparetheinferencecostoftheaboveVL-JEPAand
theVLMbypre-loading64videoframesintomemoryand
repeatedly decoding text 100 times with the same prompt,
measuring the average time per sample. As shown in
Fig.3(rightmost),bothmodelsexhibitcomparablelatency
when generating text. What differentiates our model
from classical VLM is the decoupling between the prompt
processing (“Query Embedding”) and the video encoder
(“Encoder+Predictor”)fromthetextgenerationmodule
(“Decoder”). This allows us to only use the first part of
the model to perform retrieval and decode text only when
needed(seeSection4.5below),makingourmodelmore
scalable for online video inference.
4.5 Effectiveness of Selective Decoding
Evaluation Setup.We evaluate the effectiveness of VL-
JEPA’sembedding-guidedselectivedecodingonlong-form
video streams. To this end, we design a benchmark taskwhere the goal is to recover a temporal sequence of an-
notationswhileminimizingthenumberoftextdecoding
operations,whichdominateinferencecost. Asshownin
Fig. 4 (left), decoding is performed only at selected points
alongtheVL-JEPAembeddingstream,yieldingasequence
of𝑁decodedoutputs[(ˆ𝑡1,ˆ𝑦1),(ˆ𝑡2,ˆ𝑦2),...,(ˆ𝑡𝑁,ˆ𝑦𝑁)]. Each
ground-truth annotation [(𝑡1,𝑦1),(𝑡 2,𝑦2),...,(𝑡𝑇,𝑦𝑇)]is
thenalignedtoitsnearestdecodedoutputintime(illus-
tratedas◦···◦inFig.4),andCIDEriscomputedbetween
matched pairs. We use the EgoExo4D [Grauman et al.,
2024] validation set in procedural activity domains, which
consistsof218videoswithanaveragedurationof6min-
utes and about 𝑇=143 atomic action annotations per
video.
As a baseline, we consideruniform sampling, where de-
codingpointsareplacedatfixedintervalsregardlessofthe
underlying video content. StandardstreamingVLMs are
limited to this strategy, whereas VL-JEPA supports a more
effectivealternative:adaptiveselectionofdecodingpoints
guided by its predicted embeddings. We apply agglom-
erativeclusteringwithtemporalconnectivityconstraints
[MurtaghandContreras,2012]topartitiontheembedding
sequence into 𝑁segments of high intra-segment monose-
manticity[Chenetal.,2024a],measuredbyvariance(i.e.,
Ward distance). The intuition is that within a semantically
coherent segment, decoded outputs are highly similar, so
decoding once per segment captures the essential infor-
mation while greatly reducing overall decoding cost. The

Results.As shown in Fig. 4 (right), we sweep the av-
erage decoding frequency from 2.0 Hz down to 0.01 Hz
(i.e.,averageintervalsbetweenconsecutivedecodingop-
erations from 0.5s to 100s) by adjusting either the stride
of uniform sampling or the number of clusters in adap-
tiveselection. Acrosstheentirerange,adaptiveselection

ticular, selective decoding at 0.35 Hz (i.e., ∼2.85s interval)
matches the performance of uniform decoding at 1 Hz,
reducing decoding cost by ∼2.85×. We further observe
that average pooling provides consistent gains for both
strategies, since it provides denoising and stabilization on
embeddings prior feeding into the decoder.

using autoregressive generation and chain-of-thought
prompting[Weietal.,2022]. Text-spaceLLMshaverapidly
improved and now achieve strong results on a wide range
ofbenchmarks. However,thediscretenatureoftheirrea-
soning trace may limit both speed and performance in
thelongterm. Severalworkshaveexploredlatent-space
LLMs that process or reason in latent space, such as Large
Concept Models [Barrault et al., 2024] and COCONUT
[Hao et al., 2024]. These models focus on unimodal latent-
space reasoning. With VL-JEPA, our goal is to align vision
and text representations in a shared multi-modal latent
space. This approach aims to enable better abstractions
and improve both the performance and speed of vision-
language models (VLMs). We hope VL-JEPA will serve as
a foundation for future work on multi-modal latent space
reasoning, including visual chain-of-thought methods [Li
et al., 2025a].
6 Conclusion
WehavepresentedVL-JEPA,anewvision–languagemodel
built upon the joint embedding predictive architecture.
Byshiftingsupervisionfromdiscretetokenspacetocon-
tinuous semantic embedding space, VL-JEPA simplifies
the learning target, avoids redundant modeling of sur-
face linguistic variability, and enables non-autoregressive
prediction. Through controlled experiments, we show
that VL-JEPA outperforms generative VLMs trained with
cross-entropy loss under matched training data budget,
while achieving superior training efficiency and signifi-
cantly lower inference latency. Beyond generation tasks,
the embedding-based design further allows VL-JEPA to
handle open-vocabulary classification and cross-modal
retrieval within a single unified architecture. Its ability
to emit continuous semantic embeddings also makes it
particularly well suited for real-time video applications,
where selective decoding can improve both responsive-
ness and efficiency. In this work, we demonstrated the
advantages of VL-JEPA over standard VLMs, particularly
in computational efficiency, streaming applications, and
video-language tasks. Our goal at this stage, is not to
propose a universal alternative to VLMs, as this would
requirebroaderevaluationontaskssuchasreasoning,tool
use,andagenticbehaviorswherecurrenttokengenerative
VLMs excel. Finally, although our results show clear bene-
fitsfromscalingparametersanddatasetsize,wedidnot
fully explore this direction, leaving it for future work.
